The purpose of this homework exercise was to refractor existing code to make it more accessible.

The client is a marketing agency who wants a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that their site is optimized for search engines.

What was involved:

- The HTML code was reordered to follow the semantic structure, making easier to read and follow.
- A link in the header needed to be repaired
- The CSS file was updated to reflect the changes in the HTML file
- The footer had to be hidden
- The page elements had to be resized to reflect the desired look
